# Inventory Application

## Inventory Application - Overview

This is the third project of the "NodeJS" course within "The Odin Project".

This project is used to practice integrating a database to an application.

In particular, this project aims to create a very basic inventory application, where you can create, read, update and delete various items in an inventory.

*Please note that the password storing and handling mechanisms here are very rudimentary; I've mainly added it here to provide more depth to the application.*
